EVM Kit uses a CLI to clone a template repository onto your local machine.

<Tip>
  **Pre-requisites**: You will need Node.js, npm, Yarn, and Git installed on
  your machine to use the CLI.
</Tip>

## 1/ Create the Project

Run the command below to get started:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx evmkit@latest create my-evmkit-app
```

```bash yarn
yarn create evmkit-app my-evmkit-app
```

```html pnpm
pnpx evmkit@latest create my-evmkit-app
```

</CodeGroup>

Open the project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
The repository comes with a set of [recommended extensions](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/.vscode/extensions.json)
for building web3 apps; when you open the project, VS Code will prompt you to install them.
For the best IDE experience, it's recommended to install these extensions.

## 2/ Get a thirdweb API Key

Create a (free) [thirdweb API key](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys) using the thirdweb dashboard.
Once created, copy the `Client ID` and `Secret Key` values presented to you.

At the root of the `application` directory in your EVM Kit project, create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name the file `.env`.

Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_API_KEY` and `THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY` values in the `.env` file to the values you copied from the thirdweb dashboard:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_API_KEY` is the `Client ID` value.
- `THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY` is the `Secret Key` value.

## 3/ Install Dependencies

The application is split into two directories, `application`, and `contracts`; for the frontend and smart contracts respectively.

The recommended way to use the IDE for this setup is to open a new [split terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics#:~:text=Multiple%20terminals%20can%20be%20placed,tab%20on%20the%20terminal%20panel.)
inside your VS Code window; one for each directory.
This way, you can work simultaneously on the frontend and smart contracts.

First, install the dependencies for each directory. See the sections below for more information:

1. [application](#application) - setup the frontend application
2. [contracts](#contracts) - setup the smart contracts

### application

```bash
# 1. Change directory to the application folder
cd application

# 2. Install dependencies
yarn

# 3. Start the application
yarn dev
```

### contracts

```bash
# 1. Change directory to the contracts folder
cd contracts

# 2. Install dependencies
yarn

# 3. Build the contracts (optional)
yarn build
```

You'll now be able to view your application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
