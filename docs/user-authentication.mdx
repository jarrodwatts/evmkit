title: "User Authentication (SIWE)"
---

You may need to know a user's wallet address on the server-side, for use cases such as token-gated
pages or [signature-based minting](https://portal.thirdweb.com/glossary/signature-based-minting).

Providing the user's wallet address from the client is not secure, as it can be spoofed.
Instead, the [EIP-4361 Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) standard can be used to ask the user to
prove ownership of their wallet address by signing a message, and then verifying the signature on the server-side.

EVM Kit uses [thirdweb Auth](https://portal.thirdweb.com/auth) to provide this SIWE functionality, which uses a 3-step process:

1. Server generates a message for the user to sign _(message follows SIWE standard)_.
2. User signs the message with their wallet, proving ownership of the wallet address.
3. Server verifies the signature and the user enters authenticated state.

Since we are using Next.js, the client and server are both in the `/application` directory.

The app comes with a [UserAuthentication](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/components/demo/UserAuthentication.tsx)
component to showcase the SIWE flow and access of restricted server-side data.

## Configuration

Two environment variables can be set in `.env` to configure the SIWE flow:

```bash
AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=        # To sign messages with your wallets private key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN= # Set this to your website domain to appear in the message.
```

## Generating Messages

The [Connect Wallet Button](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.connectwallet#auth-optional)
comes with an `auth` prop, that can be used to showcase a "Sign In" state after the user connects their wallet.

When the user clicks the "Sign In" button, a message is generated and the user is prompted to sign it using their connected wallet.

```jsx
<ConnectWallet auth={{ loginOptional: false }} />
```

## Signing Messages

The user signs the message with their wallet, and the signature is sent to the server.

You define the server logic location using the `authConfig` prop on the
[ThirdwebProvider](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.thirdwebprovider#authconfig-optional).
You can see this inside the [\_app.tsx](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/pages/_app.tsx) file:

```jsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  authConfig={{
    domain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN || "evmkit.com", // Your website
    authUrl: "/api/auth", // API Route (default: pages/api/auth/[...thirdweb].ts)
  }}
>
  <Component {...pageProps} />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

## Verifying Signatures

The signed message arrives at the server, and the server verifies the signature's validity.

The application comes with a `/pages/api/auth/[...thirdweb].ts`
[catch-all dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments)
which handles `/login`, `/logout`, and `/user` requests under the hood.

In this flow, the `/login` route is triggered which verifies the signature and sets a `thirdweb_auth_token` cookie for this user to remain
authenticated for future requests.

## Accessing Restricted Data

Now the user is authenticated, you can use the [useUser](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.useuser) hook to access their authentication information
from the client, as well as the [useLogin](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.uselogin) and
[useLogout](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.uselogout) hooks to manage the user's authentication state.

You can also restrict access to content based on the user's authentication status or their wallet address on the server-side.
The application showcases this in the [secret.ts](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/pages/api/secret.ts) API route:

```jsx
import { getUser } from "./auth/[...thirdweb]";
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

const handler = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  // Get the user of the request
  const user = await getUser(req);

  // Check if the user is authenticated
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      message: "No user is signed in.",
    });
  }

  // e.g. use the user's authenticated wallet address on server.
  return res.status(200).json({
    message: `${user.address}`,
  });
};

export default handler;
```
