title: "Connecting to Wallets"
---

EVM Kit uses thirdweb's [Wallet SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/wallet) to enable users to connect their wallets
and interact with smart contracts. It powers all kinds of onboarding flows for users, including browser wallets,
[ERC-4337](https://blog.jarrodwatts.com/what-is-account-abstraction-and-how-does-eip-4337-work) account abstraction, email login, and more.

The application is wrapped in the [ThirdwebProvider](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.thirdwebprovider) component; which is where you define
which wallet connection options you want to support. You can see this in the [\_app.tsx](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/pages/_app.tsx)
file.

```jsx pages/_app.tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  // Provide an array of supported wallets to this prop.
  supportedWallets={[metamaskWallet()]}
>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

The app comes with a [WalletConnection](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/components/demo/WalletConnection.tsx)
component to demonstrate how the [ConnectWallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.connectwallet) component behaves with various options enabled.

## Configuring Wallet Connection Options

Inside the `pages/_app.tsx` file, configure the [supportedWallets](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional)
option of the `ThirdwebProvider` context provider component. This is an array of wallet connection options that will be presented to the user when you
render the [ConnectWallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.connectwallet) component.

By default, no `supportedWallets` prop is defined, which defaults to support [browser wallets](#browser-wallets) only. More information on available options is listed below.

### Browser Wallets

Use the thirdweb documentation to add browser wallets to the `supportedWallets` array:

- [MetaMask](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.coinbasewallet#usage-with-connectwallet)
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.coinbasewallet#usage-with-connectwallet)
- [WalletConnect](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.walletconnect#usage-with-connectwallet) V1 and V2

### Local Wallet (Guest Flow)

Abstract away the wallet connection flow by creating wallets for user's under the hood.

Follow the [Local Wallet Documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.localwallet#usage-with-connectwallet).

### Account Abstraction

Create new smart wallets for user's that follow the EIP-4337 account abstraction standard and interact
with smart contracts using this new wallet.
thirdweb provides the infrastructure such as the paymaster and bundler for you to use this feature.

Note: this is not available on mainnet environments at this time. [See supported chains](https://portal.thirdweb.com/wallet/smart-wallet#supported-chains).

To add support for account abstraction in your EVM Kit project:

1. Deploy an [AccountFactory](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory) smart contract to your desired chain.
2. In your `.env` file, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_FACTORY` variable to your deployed Account Factory smart contract address.

### Email / Phone Number Wallets

To create a "web2" onboarding experience with email/phone number, you can use
[Magic.Link](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.magiclink) or
[Paper Wallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.paperwallet) to create a wallet associated with this email/phone for the user.

#### Magic.Link

Sign up for [Magic Link Auth](https://magic.link/auth) and get an API key.

Inside an `.env` file, add your API key:

```env
# Magic Link (Email Wallets)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGIC_LINK_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then, follow the [Magic.Link](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.magiclink) documentation.

#### Paper Wallet

Sign up for [Paper](https://withpaper.com/) and get a client ID.

Inside an `.env` file, add your client ID:

```env
# Paper Wallet (Email Wallets)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAPER_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then, follow the [Paper Wallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.paperwallet) documentation.
