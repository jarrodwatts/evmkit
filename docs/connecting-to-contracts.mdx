title: "Connecting to Contracts"
---

Now you've deployed your smart contracts (or plan on using existing ones), you're ready to
connect to them in your application.

The `/application` directory contains a `/const` directory, which has two files:

1. `chains.ts`: Define the testnet and mainnet chains your smart contracts are deployed to.
2. `contracts.ts`: Define the addresses of your smart contracts on each chain.

Configure these files to connect to your smart contracts.

## Configuring Chains

The application assumes you have two separate environments. One for testing purposes and one for production. You can choose to use
separate chains for each environment, or simply use the same chain for both.

All you need to do is configure the `DEVELOPMENT_CHAIN` and `PRODUCTION_CHAIN` variables to your chosen chains, and you're good to go.

By default, the application uses the Polygon `Mumbai` test network for testing and the Polygon `Mainnet` network for production:

```ts Example: Use Mumbai for testing and Polygon for production
import { Polygon, Mumbai } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

export const IS_DEV_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development";

const DEVELOPMENT_CHAIN = Mumbai; // e.g. Mumbai used for local development
const PRODUCTION_CHAIN = Polygon; // e.g. Polygon used for production

export const CHAIN = IS_DEV_ENV ? DEVELOPMENT_CHAIN : PRODUCTION_CHAIN;
```

The `IS_DEV_ENV` detects whether you're running the application in a development environment or not.
The `CHAIN` variable uses that value to return your chosen development chain in development and your chosen production chain in production.

## Configuring Contract Addresses

The `contracts.ts` file is where you put the addresses of your smart contracts.

For each smart contract you want to connect to, you can follow the same pattern below:

1. Define a variable containing the testnet address of your smart contract.
2. Define a variable containing the mainnet address of your smart contract.
3. Export a variable that returns the testnet address in development and the mainnet address in production _(and cast it
   as the test network address's type)_.

```ts
const greeter_dev = "0x2E74A1664dA1066FFa4aF8b85856cb474D189029"; // e.g. Mumbai
const greeter_prod = "0x123456789123456789123456789123456789123"; // e.g. Polygon

// Export this to use as the address of your smart contract throughout the app.
export const greeter = IS_DEV_ENV
  ? greeter_dev // Will be the test network address in development
  : (greeter_prod as typeof greeter_dev); // and main network address in production
```

No smart contract ABI is required when using the thirdweb React SDK; it is either fetched at run-time or pulled from the
[generation](#generating-contract-types) process.

## Generating Contract Types

Since we don't copy smart contract ABIs into the application; our IDE doesn't know what functions, views, events, etc. are available on each smart contract. Without this,
we don&rsquo;t get any help from our IDE when interacting with smart contracts.

The thirdweb CLI comes with a [generate](https://portal.thirdweb.com/cli/generate) command, which detects all smart contract addresses in the project
and fetches their ABIs, pulling them into node_modules to enable type-safety on smart contract interactions like
[useContractRead](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontractread) and [useContractWrite](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontractwrite).

<Tip>
  If you prefer, you *can* just provide the contract ABIs as the second argument
  to
  [useContract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontract#contract-abi-optional)
  to achieve the same effect of type-safety and performance gains.
</Tip>

To get this type-safety, run `yarn generate` from the application directory. This will create a `thirdweb.json` file at the root of your app;
which you can modify and re-run `yarn generate` to pull in new ABIs, or update existing ones.

```bash
yarn generate
```

For example, running `yarn generate` with the below configuration inside `thirdweb.json` will pull in the ABI for the
`0x2E7` smart contract on the Polygon `Mumbai` test network:

```ts thirdweb.json
{
  "chainIds": [
    80001
  ],
  "contracts": [
    {
      "address": "0x2E74A1664dA1066FFa4aF8b85856cb474D189029",
      "chainId": 80001
    }
  ]
}
```

After running `generate`, smart contract interactions become type-safe as the ABIs are now available to the IDE.
It also provides a performance increase as the function
doesn't need to fetch the ABI at run-time.

<Tip>
  Sometimes, you might need to [restart the TypeScript
  server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64454845/where-is-vscodes-restart-ts-server)
  for the IDE to pick up the new types.
</Tip>

ABIs can be found in the `/node_modules/@thirdweb-dev/generated-abis/dist` directory.

## Contract Interactions

Now you have set up your chains, contract addresses, and generated your contract types, you can start interacting with your smart contracts.

The application comes with an example [ContractInteraction](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/evmkit/blob/main/template/application/components/demo/ContractInteraction.tsx)
component to showcase the [useContract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontract), [useContractRead](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontractread) and [useContractWrite](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontractwrite) hooks
from thirdweb's React SDK.

For smart contracts that follow EIP standards, there is a range of other hooks such as [useNFT](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usenft)
documented in [thirdweb's React SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react).

<Tip>
thirdweb's hooks are powered by [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview).

for a quick introduction.

### Reading Data

For generic smart contract reads, you can use the [useContractRead](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontractread) hook.

```jsx
const { data, isLoading, error } = useContractRead(contract, "functionName");
```

### Writing Data

For initiating transactions, you can use the [useContractWrite](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.usecontractwrite) hook,
and the [Web3Button](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.web3button) to ensure the user has a connected wallet and is on the correct chain.

```jsx
const { mutateAsync, isLoading } = useContractWrite(contract, "functionName");
```
